### ‚öôÔ∏è Backend (SpringBoot Microservice)
A **Java SpringBoot RESTful API** that serves as the application's core.  
Handles business logic, prompt engineering, and securely communicates with the Gemini API.

### üß† AI Service (Google Gemini API)
Provides the **generative AI capabilities**.  
All requests are proxied through the backend to protect credentials.
